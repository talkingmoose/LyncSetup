The need for LyncSetup 1.0

LyncSetup 1.0 enables an administrator to pre-populate a user's Lync login information so that the user doesn't need to do this. When used with the MicrosoftLyncRegistrationDB.plist file to pre-populate server addresses, it will eliminate the user from having to configure his Lync client and allow him to simply enter his password and log in to his account the first time he launches the application.

The LyncSetup-1.0 script does the following:

	▪	Populates the user name from his Mac OS X login information
	▪	Populates the user email address from Active Directory
	▪	Disables the first run license agreement
	▪	Disables prompt for Conference
	▪	Disables prompt for Presence
	▪	Disables prompt for Telephone


How to install LyncSetup 1.0

	1.	Copy the LyncSetup-1.0.sh file to a commonly accessible location on each user's workstation such as /Library/talkingmoose/Scripts.
	2.	Copy the net.talkingmoose.LyncSetup.plist file to /Library/LaunchAgents.
	3.	Copy the MicrosoftLyncRegistrationDB.plist file to /Library/Preferences.


How to use LyncSetup 1.0

Before installing the script open the LyncSetup-1.0.sh script using TextEdit or Bare Bones Software's BBEdit or free TextWrangler application. Change the "TALKINGMOOSE" NetBIOS domain name to your own company's NetBIOS domain name and save the file.

The script file must be executable on each machine:

sudo chmod +x /Library/talkingmoose/Scripts/LyncSetup-1.0.sh

Use the same text editor to edit the MicrosoftLyncRegistrationDB.plist file and enter the correct server addresses:

<string>im.talkingmoose.net</string>
<string>im.talkingmoose.pvt</string>
